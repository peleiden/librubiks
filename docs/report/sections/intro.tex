\chapter{Introduction}

-- Problem challenge: Large state space, single goal state 

-- Do without domain knowledge

-- Learn to solve planning problems

-- Rooted in group theory: application of machine learning methods to mathematics
\section{State of the Art}
\cite{SolvingNature}
-- DeepCubeA solves all test configurations and generalizes to other puzzles

-- Puzzle specific pattern databases solves these rubiks well

\subsection{DeepCubeA}
\cite{SolvingNature}
-- Combines DL with approximate value iteration and weighted A* search

-- DNN approximates cost-to-go 

-- DeepCubeA builds on antorher implementation which was based on policy and Monte Carlo tree search based implementation
