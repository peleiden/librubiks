 abstract = {A difficult problem in computer cubing is to find positions that are hard—positions that are as far from solved as possible. An effective way to find such positions is to examine positions exhibiting symmetry; empirically, we see that hard positions have a higher frequency in the subset of positions exhibiting symmetry than in general. While there are many symmetric positions, they are a small fraction of all positions and belong to a few large subgroups, which enables us to solve them effectively with a coset solver.},
