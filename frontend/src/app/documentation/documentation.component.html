<h2 class="h4">Documentation</h2>
<p>
  This is a website for showing our results from our second year project at DTU (course 02466).
  It is intended to show our results in a way that allows everyone to try it out without needing to set anything up.
</p>
<p>
  The site is hosted <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
  and by default uses a Python backend hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>,
  though it is possible to host your own local webserver if you want to utilize local CUDA availability.
  The repository is available on <a href="https://github.com/peleiden/rl-rubiks">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We used <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch 1.5</a> for implementing our learning algorithm in Python.
  The site is build using <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 9</a>
  with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a> for styling.
</p>

<h2 class="h5">Starting Your Own Local Backend</h2>
<p>
  The free Heroku server we use has no CUDA and only 500 megabytes of memory, so the solvers are slow and prone to cause memory overflow errors if given too much time.
  You can start your own server by going through the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> Getting <code>librubiks</code> and dependencies, see the <a href="https://github.com/peleiden/rl-rubiks#setup" target="_blank">repo</a>.</li>
  <li> Running <code>pip install wget flask flask_cors flask_restful</code></li>
  <li> From the <code>librubiks</code> folder, run <code>python librubiks/api.py</code></li>
  <li> Choose Local in the top right corner. </li>
</ol>
<p>You will need a PyTorch compatible GPU to realize the full potential of the agents.</p>
