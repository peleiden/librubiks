  This is a website for showing our results from our second year project at DTU (course 02466).
  It is intended to show our results in a way that allows everyone to try it out without needing to set anything up.
  It also includes an extended appendix for things that are not practical to include in a report,
  such as the GIF for showing target value development, or interesting but less relevant things.

  The site is hosted <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
  and by default uses a Python backend hosted on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>,
  though it is possible to host your own local webserver if you want to utilize local CUDA availability.
  The repository is available on <a href="https://github.com/peleiden/rl-rubiks">GitHub</a>.

  We used <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch 1.5</a> for implementing our learning algorithm in Python.
  The site is build using <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 9</a>
  with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a> for styling.
