# Solving the Rubik's cube using Deep Reinforcement Learning

###### Second year project in the bachelor in Artificial Intelligence and Data, Technical University of Denmark.


## Usage

### Training
The training can be started using `src/rubiks/runtrain.py`. From the main repo folder, use
```
python src/rubiks/runtrain.py --help
```
for help on options. In many cases, using the parameters from a configuration file is preferable. An example of using this to run two trainings, can be seen be running
```
python src/rubiks/runtrain.py --config src/configs/train_ex.ini
```
